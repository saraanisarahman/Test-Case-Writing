# Test-Case-Writing

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15sAAcS6CDbt5to7t6YByRa03qm6Ns-eLUOqm0HSyTGc/edit

This is my first project of Manual Testing. I've written test cases on "Vertex Bazaar" which is an online games shop for gamers.
It provides the Cheapest Mobile Games Top Up, Free Fire Top Up, Free Fire Memberships, Game Cards, Gift Cards, PUBG Mobile Lite BC,
Google Gift Card etc.

I've written test cases for User Authentication of functional testing for both the Vertex bazaar website and its mobile app.

The above link contains 4 sheets. 1st one for the website, 2nd one for the mobile app, 3rd one contains the bug report of failed tests
of the website and 4th one contains the bug report of the mobile app.

I'll soon upload more test cases for both website and mobile, test matrics and test summary.
